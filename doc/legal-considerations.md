# Legal Considerations for LogoHub

This document outlines the legal aspects of storing, distributing, and using brand logos in the LogoHub repository.

## Disclaimer

LogoHub is designed to be a resource for developers to access brand logos for legitimate use in their projects. However, all logos are the property of their respective owners and subject to their usage guidelines and trademark laws.

## Logo Usage Guidelines

### Fair Use

Using logos in your projects may fall under "fair use" in many circumstances, such as:

- Identifying a company or product in educational or informational content
- Referring to a brand in comparative advertising
- News reporting about a company

However, fair use is limited and context-dependent. The following uses generally are NOT considered fair use:

- Suggesting endorsement or affiliation where none exists
- Using logos in a way that could cause confusion about the source of products/services
- Using logos in a way that dilutes or tarnishes a brand

### Trademark Law

Logos are typically protected by trademark law, which grants the owner exclusive rights to use their marks to identify their products or services and prevent confusion in the marketplace.

## Logo Submission Requirements

When submitting logos to LogoHub:

1. **Verify Source**: Only submit logos obtained from official sources
2. **Include Attribution**: Note the source and copyright information in metadata
3. **Link to Guidelines**: Include a link to the company's official brand guidelines
4. **Document Restrictions**: Note any known usage restrictions
5. **No Modifications**: Do not submit modified versions of official logos

## Safe Usage Practices for Developers

When using logos from LogoHub in your projects:

1. **Check Brand Guidelines**: Always review the company's logo usage guidelines
2. **Provide Attribution**: Include appropriate attribution when required
3. **Maintain Separation**: Ensure your design clearly separates your content from logos
4. **No Endorsement Claims**: Do not imply endorsement or official partnership
5. **Respect Size Requirements**: Many brands have minimum size requirements
6. **Maintain Quality**: Do not use logos in low-quality formats or inappropriate contexts

## Takedown Process

LogoHub has a process for removing logos when requested by the trademark owner:

1. Trademark owners can submit takedown requests via GitHub issues or email
2. LogoHub maintainers will promptly review requests
3. Valid requests will result in logo removal within 48 hours
4. Users will be notified of removed logos

## Disclaimer of Liability

LogoHub does not guarantee that usage of any logo in the repository is legally permissible in all contexts. Users are responsible for:

1. Ensuring their use complies with applicable laws
2. Getting necessary permissions where fair use does not apply
3. Complying with individual brand usage guidelines
4. Assuming all liability for their use of logos
