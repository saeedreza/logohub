# Reference Models for LogoHub

This document outlines reference projects that serve as inspiration and guidance for LogoHub's architecture, design, and implementation.

## Lucide Icons

[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide)) is an open-source icon library that provides an excellent reference model for LogoHub.

### Key Features to Adopt

#### 1. Package Architecture

Lucide uses a monorepo structure with separate packages for different frameworks:

- **Core Package**: Contains the icon definitions and shared utilities
- **Framework Packages**: Framework-specific implementations (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Static Package**: Pre-generated SVG files for direct use

For LogoHub, we should follow this pattern with:
- `logohub-core`: Logo definitions, metadata, and utilities
- `logohub-react`, `logohub-vue`, etc.: Framework-specific components
- `logohub-static`: Pre-generated SVG, PNG, WebP files

#### 2. API Design

Lucide's API is consistent across frameworks and allows customization:

```jsx
// React example
import { Coffee } from 'lucide-react';

<Coffee color="red" size={48} strokeWidth={1} />
```

LogoHub should implement a similar API:

```jsx
// Example goal for LogoHub
import { Google } from 'logohub-react';

<Google color="blue" size={64} variant="monochrome" />
```

#### 3. Documentation Approach

Lucide's documentation provides:
- Visual icon browser
- Framework-specific usage examples
- API reference
- Contribution guidelines

LogoHub's documentation should follow this pattern, with added sections for logo usage guidelines and legal considerations.

#### 4. Build Pipeline

Lucide has an automated build process that:
- Validates and optimizes SVGs
- Generates framework-specific code
- Creates distribution files
- Updates documentation

LogoHub should implement a similar pipeline that additionally:
- Validates metadata files
- Generates multiple formats (SVG, PNG, WebP)
- Creates different sizes for raster formats

#### 5. Community Management

Lucide has successfully built a strong community with:
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Active maintainers
- Good issue and PR management
- Regular releases

LogoHub should adopt these practices, with additional focus on:
- Company participation for logo submissions and updates
- Clear attribution and legal guidelines
- Versioning for logo updates

## Implementation Priorities Based on Lucide

1. **Start with the Core**: Build the core functionality for logo management
2. **React First**: Begin with a React package for wider adoption
3. **Documentation Early**: Invest in quality documentation from the start
4. **Clear API Design**: Establish a consistent API across all packages
5. **Build Pipeline**: Set up automation for validation and format generation

## Differences from Lucide

While Lucide is an excellent reference, LogoHub has unique needs:

1. **Legal Considerations**: Logos have trademark implications that icons don't
2. **Multiple Formats**: Need to support both vector and raster formats
3. **Metadata Importance**: Each logo needs detailed metadata (owner, guidelines, etc.)
4. **Update Process**: Companies need a way to update their logos
5. **Authentication**: API access needs authentication and rate limiting

By following Lucide's strengths while addressing these unique considerations, LogoHub can build a successful and sustainable platform for logo management.
