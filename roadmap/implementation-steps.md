## ðŸš¨ **Updated Risk Assessment**

### **Acceptable Risks (Early Stage)**
- **API Abuse**: Manageable with Vercel's DDoS protection and monitoring
- **Resource Costs**: Vercel free tier sufficient for early growth
- **No User Data**: Trade-off for simplicity and adoption speed

### **Monitoring Without Barriers**
- **Vercel Analytics**: Track usage patterns without authentication
- **Error Monitoring**: Identify problems without user accounts  
- **Geographic Data**: Understand user base without registration
- **Popular Content**: See which logos are most requested

### **Natural Growth Triggers for Authentication**
- **High usage costs**: When Vercel bill becomes significant
- **User requests**: When developers ask for higher rate limits
- **Community features**: When users want to save/share customizations
- **Business interest**: When companies want to manage their logos
